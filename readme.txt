== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to know any coding to use this plugin? =

No, we have built Ultimate Member to be extremely easy to use and does not require you to manually build shortcodes or have any coding knowledge.

= Is Ultimate Member mobile responsive? =

Yes. Ultimate Member is designed to adapt nicely to any screen resolution. It includes specific designs for phones, tablets and desktops.

= Is Ultimate Member multi-site compatible? =

Yes. Ultimate Member works great on both single site and multi-site WordPress installs.

= Does the plugin work with any WordPress theme? =

Yes. Ultimate Member will work with any properly coded theme. However, some themes may cause conflicts with the plugin. If you find a styling issue with your theme please create a post in the community forum.

= Does the plugin work with caching plugins? =

The plugin works with popular caching plugins by automatically excluding Ultimate Member pages from being cached. This ensures other visitors to a page will not see the private information of another user. However, if you add features of Ultimate Member to other pages you have to exclude those pages from being cached through your cache plugin settings panel.

= Does Ultimate Member restrict access to wp-login.php when the plugin is active? =

The plugin does not restrict access to the wp-login.php page when active, so that our plugin does not interfere with the existing functionality of a website or other plugins that may utilise the default login page. If you wish to restrict access to the wp-login.php page you can use a plugin such as [WPS Hide Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-hide-login/) or another plugin that removes the ability to login via wp-login.php.

= Are Ultimate Member Login/Registration pages required? =

No, you do not need to use our plugin’s login or registration pages and can use another plugin or the default WordPress methods for user registration and login.

= Are additional PHP modules necessary for the plugin to work correctly? =

No specific extensions are needed. But we highly recommended keep active these PHP modules: `mbstring`, `json`, `dom`, `exif`, `gd`, `fileinfo`, `curl`, `iconv`. wp-admin > Tools > Site Health page has a summary about your installation and required modules. All major extensions are listed [here](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/server-environment/#php-extensions).
