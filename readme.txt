The easiest way to create powerful online communities and beautiful user profiles with WordPress

== Description ==

Ultimate Member is a powerful plugin that allows you to add beautiful user profiles to your site and create advanced online communities. The plugin enables users to sign up and become members of your site all from the front-end. With a focus on flexibility and simplicity creating a community and membership site with WordPress has never been so easy.

**Beta release**

Please note this is the first release of the plugin and whilst we have done a lot of testing to ensure plugin and theme compatibility it is possible that you may come across a bug or plugin/theme conflict. If you do we kindly ask you to post on our [community forum](https://ultimatemember.com/forums) so we can fix any potential issues you may find.

Features of the plugin include:

* Front-end user registration
* Front-end user login
* Front-end user profiles
* Custom profile fields
* Drag and drop form builder
* User account page
* Custom user roles
* Searchable member directories
* Custom e-mail templates
* Content restriction
* Conditional menus
* Mobile adaptive & responsive
* SEO optimized
* Developer friendly with dozens of actions and filters

**Front-end registration**

Ultimate Member allows visitors to your site to register and become members. You can decide whether users can register automatically; require them to active account via email link or you an admin can manually approve/reject user registrations after reviewing details.

**Front-end login**

Allow users to login directly from your site and avoid the ugly WordPress login page. You can decide where users are redirected to after logging in and set custom redirects depending on the user's role.

**User profiles**

Ultimate Member gives every user of your site a beautiful user profile where they can edit their information. You can create unique profiles for each user role and decide what information to show on the profiles.

**Custom profile fields**

With our custom profile fields, Ultimate Member allows you to gather any information you like from user's when they register or when they fill in their profiles. The plugin comes with a full range of field types including: text box, textarea, dropdown, multi-select, radio, checkbox, url, password, image upload, file upload, date picker, time picker and star ratings.

**Drag and drop form builder**

Our advanced drag and drop form builder makes it extremely easy to build unique registration, login and profile forms for your site. The form builder allows for up to three columns and multiple rows which enables you to create distinct sections to the forms.

**User account page**

The plugin provides users with an account page where users can change their account settings. The account page allows users to control their privacy settings, change their password and delete their own account. Admins can alter what shows on the account page depending on the amount of control you want users to have over their accounts.

**User roles**

With Ultimate Member you can create your own user roles and apply different controls and permissions to each user role. This flexibility is perfect for site's that have multiple user types.

**Member directories**

The plugin allows you to create multiple member directories to allow people to easily search and find other users. The member directories are very flexible and you can control what user roles show in a directory; the order users appear in the directory; what search filters appear; what user roles can use the search filters and much more.

**Email Templates**

The plugin provides a range of customizable text only email templates which are triggered depending on certain events (e.g welcome email, account activation, account deleted etc). Each email type can be turned on/off. The plugin also offers a range of optional admin notification emails so you can find out when a new user registers or if new user needs reviewed.

**Content restriction**

With Ultimate Member you can restrict content on a global on per page/post basis. You can restrict pages/posts so everyone can see the page/post; only logged out users can see the page/post or only logged in users can see the page/post (you can also restrict it to certain user roles). You can also set redirect urls for when people who are not allowed to access the page/post

**Conditional Menus**

The plugin provides a range of customizable text only email templates which are triggered depending on certain events (e.g welcome email, account activation, account deleted etc). Each email type can be turned on/off. The plugin also offers a range of optional admin notification emails so you can find out when a new user registers or if new user needs reviewed.

**Mobile adaptive & responsive**

Ultimate Member has been built with a focus on mobile and is fully mobile adaptive and responsive. The plugin has completely separate designs for mobiles, tablets and larger screens which means the plugin will look and function great on all devices.

**SEO optimized**

The plugin is very SEO friendly and provides customizable dynamic page titles and meta descriptions for every user of your site.

= Does the plugin work with caching plugins? =

The plugin works with popular caching plugins by automatically excluding Ultimate Member pages from being cached. This ensures other visitors to a page will not see the private information of another user. However, if you add features of Ultimate Member to other pages you have to exclude those pages from being cached through your cache plugin settings panel.

We are currently in beta phase so at the moment the plugin only works on single site installs. However, we will be working on ensuring multisite compatibility during the beta period.
